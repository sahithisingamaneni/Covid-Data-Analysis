# 🦠 Covid Data Analysis

## 📄 Overview
This project explores the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic using various datasets. It combines SQL, R programming, and Tableau to extract, analyze, and visualize key trends in Covid-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations. The goal is to leverage data analytics to provide meaningful insights into the progression and control of the pandemic.

## 📂 Project Structure
The repository contains the following files:
- **`Covid analysis in R.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook for data analysis and visualization using R.
- **`Covid data analysis.twbx`**: Tableau workbook for interactive visualizations.
- **`Covid_deaths.xlsx`**: Dataset containing Covid-19 death statistics.
- **`Covid_vaccination.xlsx`**: Dataset with vaccination details by region.
- **`covid_data_analysis.sql`**: SQL queries used for data extraction and analysis.
- **`README.md`**: Documentation for the project.
