# Covid-Data-Analysis

The COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization project aims to explore, clean, analyze, and visualize the COVID-19 dataset sourced from Ourworldindata. This project utilizes MS SQL for data cleaning and preparation, followed by Tableau for creating insightful and interactive visualizations. By transforming raw COVID-19 data into meaningful insights and engaging visual representations, the project contributes to a better understanding of the pandemic's impact.

Additionally I have included the code to an IBM project on Covid Data analysis which was one of the main inspiration behind the Project. The data set and analysis used in this porject are different than the one used for the above mentioned project.




Project Steps:

**Data Collection:**

  -Obtained the COVID-19 dataset from Ourworldindata, ensuring it includes global and regional data.
  
â€‹**Data Cleaning and Preparation:**

  -Utilized MS SQL for data cleaning, dealing with missing values, and standardizing formats.
  
  -Ensured data integrity by addressing inconsistencies and errors in the dataset.
  
  
**Exploratory Data Analysis:**

  -Calculated and visualized key statistics such as total cases, deaths, and recoveries.
  
  -Analyzed trends and patterns in infection rates and mortality rates.
  
  -Explored variations in COVID-19 impact across different geographical regions.
  
  
**Data Visualization in Tableau:**

  -Transformed cleaned data into visualizations including line charts, bar graphs, heatmaps, and geographical maps.
  
  -Created interactive dashboards for a comprehensive overview of the pandemic's impact.
  
  
**Insight Generation:**

  -Identified factors contributing to the rapid spread of the virus.
  
  -Explored correlations between government interventions and disease progression.
  
  -Examined the effectiveness of measures such as lockdowns and vaccination campaigns.

  
**Public Dissemination:**

  -Uploaded cleaned dataset and Tableau visualizations to Tableau Public for public access.
  
  -Shared project findings through social media and presentations.
  



Project Timeline:

**Week 1: Project Setup and Data Collection**

  -Project kickoff, define objectives, and finalize the scope.
  
  -Download the COVID-19 dataset from Kaggle, verify its contents.
  
  -Set up the database environment for MS SQL, load the dataset.

  
**Week 2: Data Cleaning and Preparation**

  -Perform an initial assessment of data quality and cleanliness.
  
  -Identify and handle missing values using SQL.
  
  -Standardize formats, correct inconsistencies, and create necessary tables.
  
  
**Week 3-4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

  -Calculate basic statistics: total cases, deaths, recoveries.
  
  -Create line charts to visualize the progression of cases and deaths over time.
  
  -Analyze regional variations using bar graphs and geographical maps.
  
  -Investigate correlations between variables like interventions and infection rates.
  
  
**Week 5-6: Data Visualization in Tableau**

  -Familiarize yourself with Tableau, load cleaned data.
  
  -Create basic visualizations: line charts, bar graphs.
  
  -Design interactive dashboards for a comprehensive view.
  
  -Experiment with different visualization types (heatmaps, scatter plots).
  
  
**Week 7: Insight Generation**

  -Review EDA findings and initial Tableau visualizations.
  -Derive insights related to infection trends, regional disparities, interventions, etc.
